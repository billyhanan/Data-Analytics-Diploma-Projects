"Geographical Breakdown for enterprises is an approximation. The "
"county breakdown is based on the address at which an enterprise is "
"registered for Revenue purposes, rather than where the business "
"actually operates from, because no comprehensive administrative data "
"source is currently available for business locations. In particular, "
"where an enterprise has local units in several counties, but one head "
"office where all employment is registered, all its employees will be "
"counted against the county where the head office is located. "
"Enterprises where the county location is categorised as Unknown "
"generally have Revenue registered addresses outside of the Republic "
"of Ireland. However, the employees registered with these addresses "
"are working in the Republic of Ireland.  "
"NACE Code 64.20 Activities of holding companies is excluded from "
"Sector K. .. indicates that the data has been suppressed to protect "
"the confidentiality of individual enterprises. "
